# VeilX
VeilX proposes an innovative document redaction and locker tool combining machine learning (ML) with blockchain technology. Designed to ensure user privacy, security, and control, VeilX addresses the challenge of securely redacting sensitive information from documents. The solution leverages prompt-based and degree-based redaction, offering personalized and context-aware precision. It integrates decentralized storage via IPFS and employs blockchain-based data monetization, incentivizing users to share redacted data securely.

Using state-of-the-art tools such as PyMuPDF, PaddleOCR, and Llama 3.1 for text and image redaction, and deploying smart contracts on the Avalanche blockchain, VeilX ensures transparency and decentralized control. The system is scalable, globally adoptable, and aligns with growing demands for privacy-centric solutions across sectors like healthcare and legal.

VeilX is positioned to tap into the $4.17B data monetization market, making it both profitable and feasible with significant potential for global expansion.
